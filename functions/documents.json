    "description": "Ambrose Rigge (1635-1705) was early convinced of the truth through the preaching of George Fox, and grew to be a powerful minister of the gospel, a faithful elder, and a great sufferer for the cause of Christ. In one of his letters, he writes, “I have been in eleven prisons in this county, one of which held me ten years, four months and upward, besides twice premunired, and once publicly lashed, and many other sufferings too long to relate here.” Yet through all he kept the faith, and served the Lord’s body even while in bonds, through letters and papers given to encourage and establish the flock. Ambrose Rigge was one of many in his generation who sold all to buy the Pearl of great price, and having found true treasure, he kept it till the end.",

Humbling herself before God and men, she was exalted by the Lord as a powerful and prophetic minister, one of the few in her day who stood in the purity and power of the original Quakers, even while all around her the 200 year old lampstand of the Society of Friends slowly and tragically burned out.",

Left an orphan at a very young age, Wheeler was placed by as an apprentice on a sailing vessel where, along with learning sailing and navigation, he became acquainted with every form of vice and immorality. After six years in the navy and seven years in the army, the Lord made use of a hurricane at sea to awaken him to his lost condition. Being mercifully enabled to repent, and also to see the “entire spirituality of the Gospel dispensation,” he soon left the army and joined the Society of Friends in London. His growth in grace was quick and steady, and after some years he became a minister of great esteem. When Emperor Alexander I of Russia requested the assistance of a Quaker farmer from England, Wheeler moved his family to near St. Petersburg, where they lived for a number of lonely but instructive years. Afterwards, he was led by the Lord to preach the gospel of Christ throughout the South Pacific Ocean.",

Though she forever maintained a low view of herself and her spiritual attainments, she was considered by all to be a pillar in church, traveling in the capacity of a minister well into her eighties, and often being led of the Lord, in old age, to visit hardened prisoners who were condemned to death. She remained spiritually green and fruitful to the very end of her life, and died with a heart full of life, wisdom, and deep spiritual experience at 97 years of age.",

Nothing but inward light can expel inward darkness; nothing less than eternal life can deliver our souls from the power of death.

On this subject he once wrote - “Unless I had felt ​the Lord’s​ blessed presence to strengthen and qualify me, I would rather have laid down my life, than have attempted to minister to the people by virtue of any ​knowledge or ability​, natural or acquired, which, as a man, I might possess.​”",

At one point, after conversing with young James, a distinguished Justice of the Peace so admired his propensity for learning that he offered to pay his way through university. But although such flattery sowed seeds of pride and vanity in James’ young heart, it pleased the Lord to visit him in power and love, and he was prevailed upon to give up all that he had once called gain to follow Christ. James Gough became a wise and well-beloved minister among the Society of Friends, but having learned to live low at the feet of His Master, he was always remarkable for his deep humility, and low opinion of himself.",

As an adult he became master of boarding schools in Cork, Dublin, and Lisburn, but was also very active in the work of the ministry, both preaching and writing for the advancement of the gospel. In 1782, when sixty-one years of age, he commenced his four-volume History of the Society of Friends, which occupied him for eight years, and was published in 1790. This immense work gave a full, clear, and accurate portrayal of the history of Friends, adding valuable information to what had already been recorded in Sewel’s “History,” and continuing the history of this people until 1764.",

Though a farmer by trade, and a man of limited education, his deep spiritual understanding, piercing discernment, and powerful preaching of the gospel caused multitudes to acknowledge that he spoke in the demonstration of the Spirit and power, as one having authority, and not as the scribes. Sadly, he is best known for a single (and deeply regretted) act of folly committed in a time of weakness and temptation, when, “because of the abundance of revelation” and the unchecked flattery of a few imprudent admirers, he accepted greater praise than is due to any man. The Lord, however, brought him to a clear sight and sense of his error, and having heartily renounced and repented for all wrong, he was restored to fellowship and usefulness in the body of Christ for the remainder of his days.",

For fourteen years she wrestled with a variety of inward enemies as she sought to truly know and be conformed to the Beloved of her soul. And when at last she came to a measure of peace and stability in the Truth, she was then made to suffer the loss of her husband and seven children to a variety of illnesses. But the more she lost of the world, the more she seemed to gain of Christ, and her experiences of God’s power and mercy in her latter years are indescribably beautiful.",

On occasions, while preaching, he would suddenly stop speaking and sit down, explaining later that, having lost a sense of the authority and direction of the Spirit of God, he could do nothing without it.

Having experienced the spiritual baptism which saves, and abiding in a state of watchfulness and humility, he grew from stature to stature and became an upright minister and father in the church, traveling diligently in the work of the ministry as an example to all in word, conduct, faith and​ love. Three days before his death, though weak and unable to stand on his own, he said to those standing by his bedside, “I feel more life, more light, more love and sweetness than ever before,” and then speaking more of the divine refreshment and comfort he felt flowing like a pure stream to his inward man, he said, “I feel that which lives beyond death and the grave.”",

Having seen his true condition, and been somewhat awakened to Christ’s baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire, he “denied himself, picked up his cross, and followed Christ,” and so was made vessel of honor in the Lord’s house. His struggles were many and painful, both with the enemies of his own soul, and with the declining condition of the Society of Friends. But John Conran kept the faith, and finished his race a monument to the heart-cleansing power of grace.",

    "description": "The life of John Richardson (1667-1753) is a powerful confirmation of Jesus’ words, that heavenly things “are hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes,” and that His “power is made perfect in weakness.” Though starting out in life a poor farm boy with little education, Richardson became a faithful student in the Holy Spirit’s school of Christ, where he not only learned spiritual truths and heavenly mysteries, but came to experience his garments washed, his mind renewed, and his heart changed. Originally from England, he travelled as a minister for most of his adult life, twice visiting the American colonies, where he triumphantly defended the truth against “that sad apostate” George Keith.",

He was valiant for the Truth in his day, standing forth in unflinching support of the original doctrines and testimonies of the Society of Friends.

    "description": "Before Mary Alexander (1760-1809) had attained to the age of seventeen years, she was impressed with a strong apprehension that, if faithful to the manifestations of the Holy Spirit, she would be called to the work of the ministry. But having a low opinion of herself, and feeling entirely unprepared for so important a work, she was for many years reluctant to give up to the Lord’s clear leading. However, finding His Word in her heart to “like a burning fire shut up in her bones,” she at last yielded to His call and began traveling and preaching throughout England, Scotland, and Wales as the Lord gave her utterance. Mary Alexander was known to be a woman of deep humility and uncommon spiritual understanding, and one whose life was unreservedly dedicated to her Master’s cause.",

Before long, however, she began to feel that their active and outward zeal was not compatible with the spiritual poverty she felt in herself, and the great need she had seen for total dependence upon the Spirit of God for all true worship and ministry. Finding a home among the Quakers, she grew to become a powerful minister and a “mother in Israel,” traveling often, and pointing many hearts to the covenant of light and life in Jesus Christ.",

Speaking of him after his death, Thomas Ellwood wrote, “I have this testimony to bear of his honest and innocent life; he was a good steward of his Master’s treasures, a faithful dispenser of divine mysteries committed to him, an inward and heavenly-minded man. He was more in substance than in show, greater in power than in expression, a man of a meek and quiet spirit, yet full zeal—who lived and died a servant of the Lord.”",

He was called to preach the gospel when twenty-five years of age, but for a long time his appearances in the ministry were short and infrequent, feeling a dread lest he should “shoot out into the branches” without first knowing “an establishment in the Root of immortal life.” Being faithful in the little, his gift in the ministry grew, and he became one who preached in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power, clearly opening to individuals their states and conditions, and inviting all to peace with God through the effectual operation of the cross of Jesus Christ.",

Have we waited upon our God to separate the precious from the vile within, to differentiate between the pure operation of His Spirit and the wild rovings of our own soul? Have we truly known and obeyed His inward stirrings and teachings, or does the Seed of God lay buried in Christian hearts beneath a mass of superstition, assumption, and fleshy, religious activity?",

But at seventeen years of age, upon entering a meeting of the people called Quakers, he said, “I felt a secret power among them which touched my heart.” And as he abode under the powerful operations of grace, he “came to receive and bear witness of the Truth,” not being convinced “by strength of argument, or by a particular discussion of each doctrine, but by being secretly reached by Life.” Barclay’s Apology for the True Christian Divinity was first published in 1675, and came to be considered the definitive exposition and defense of Quaker principles for the next 200 years.",

Knowing this to be true, Bownas was cut to the quick, and so fervently turned to the Lord that both his heart and his conduct were greatly altered in a short time. Continuing in faithful submission to the Light of Christ, he became a minister and a sufferer for the gospel, traveling frequently in Great Britain and the American colonies, and being several times imprisoned for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Bownas was particularly conspicuous for his deep understanding concerning the work of the ministry, and became the author of a highly-regarded book entitled, “A Description of the Qualifications Necessary to a Gospel Minister.”",

Few persons, it is believed, were preserved more steadily in a state of inward watchfulness and retirement of spirit, waiting upon the Lord. And few were enabled to see more clearly, or to minister more pertinently to the states of meetings and individuals. Though he always maintained a low opinion of himself, and spoke rarely and diffidently of the fruits of his ministry, all who knew him heartily testified to the baptizing and convincing power of his gospel labors.",

Caton was quickly convinced of the truth, and gave up to its purging and sanctifying power. He was made an effectual minister of the gospel before he was twenty years of age, but lived only to his twenty-ninth year. George Fox said of him - “His innocent life preached both righteousness and truth wherever he came, and was a sweet savor to God and in the hearts of the people. He was one who had a care for God’s glory and honor, and for the spreading of the Truth and the prosperity of it. He had many trials and exercises by false brethren, backsliders, and apostates, and among priests and professors, but the Lord gave him dominion over all.”",

    "description": "William Dewsbury (1621-1688) was an eminent minister and elder in the early Society of Friends whose role in the formation and oversight of the Society was comparable to that of George Fox. Like many others in his day, Dewsbury suffered great persecution for the testimony of Jesus Christ, but never played the coward in the face of adversity. Speaking of his nineteen years of wrongful imprisonment, he declared, “I joyfully entered prisons as palaces and sang praises to my God, esteeming the bolts and locks put upon me as jewels.” After visiting William Dewsbury in 1676, John Whiting described him as “an extraordinary man in many ways, and I thought, as exact a pattern of a perfect man as I ever knew.”",

Before the Lord he was meek and submissive, but before the enemies of truth he was as bold as a lion, fearlessly “manifesting the truth to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.” His life was fraught with persecutions and prisons, being often reviled and abused for his obedience to Christ.

Evans witnessed and stood against the two unhappy divisions that greatly crippled the Society in the first half of the 19th century (the Hicksite and Gurneyite separations), contending earnestly for the original principles and practices of Friends. William and his brother Thomas were the editors and publishers of the original Friends’ Library, as well as an updated version of the four-volume work entitled Piety Promoted.",

Later in life, Penn greatly enlarged upon the original publication, treating exhaustively upon the particular sins of pride, avarice, and luxury, and adding two lengthy collections of testimonies from other authors in order to further substantiate his position. This edition is unique in that it offers the reader a careful modernization of Penn’s beautiful but somewhat archaic English, and has been abridged to contain only the principal and indispensable chapters of the treatise, wherein Penn clearly presents the nature, power, and experience of the daily cross of Christ, explaining what it is, where and how it is to be taken up, and the manner of its working in the true disciples of Christ.",

The two publications overlapped in their scope, both dealing (in various degrees) with the rise of the Society of Friends, and the distinct principles and practices of this people, and it was thought that these short books could be combined and interwoven in such a way as to present the reader with a more thorough presentation of these subjects than either publication could do individually. Penn begins with an overview of the various dispensations of God in the world, and then recounts the extraordinary work of the Lord in restoring and reestablishing the true light, life, power, and purity of the primitive church through the outpouring of His Spirit in the early Society of Friends.",

Committing himself entirely to teachings of the Spirit of Truth, and seeking to live in steady subjection to the cross, he soon felt a call to preach the gospel both on the continent of North America and in many places in Europe. He was also a great advocate for the Native Americans, sometimes accompanying them in their treaties and negotiations with the United States government, doing all in his power to ensure that they were not misled or mistreated.",
